# AegisCore

AegisCore is a C++ infrastructure project focused on building
offline-first, real-time systems that operate reliably in unstable
or low-bandwidth network environments.

The project prioritizes:
- Local-first data ownership
- Event-driven networking
- Protocol-agnostic transport layers
- Explicit separation between core infrastructure and integrations

This repository serves as a public overview and progress signal.
Core implementation lives in a private repository.
